TechSoc has worked in the Joseph Rowntree Theatre (JRT) for a number of years now to mainly to support CHMS productions, it is a venue that we enjoy working in and is the largest theatre we routinely operate in York.

## Booking the Venue
Bookings for the JRT space are handled by the Joseph Rowntree Theatre so you should look at their website explaining hires [here](https://www.josephrowntreetheatre.co.uk/hiring/) to book the space. For bigger productions it's advisable to plan a year in advance as the space is very popular. Once you have a booking get in touch with us to start to make plans for your event!

The capacity of the JRT is 365 audience members across the main body and the balcony. 
There are four backstage dressing rooms, all with interconnecting doors. All dressing rooms are equipped with mirrors with lights and washbasins. Two of the dressing rooms measure 4.1m x 4m and can each accommodate sixteen people. A further two dressing rooms are 2.6m x 4m and can each accommodate nine people. There is also a cellar area that can be used for changing in but it has no facilities, the total capacity for the backstage areas is 100 including cast, crew, helpers and chaperones.

## The Space
This is a theatre space ideal for larger plays and musicals. The space boasts a band pit that is located under the stage and can be revealed for your show, it is also the only venue in York we routinely work in that has a full hemp flying system with 10 bars available for set to be flown on with a weight limit of 88kg per bar.
The JRT team have created a great [resources section](https://www.josephrowntreetheatre.co.uk/hiring/general-information/) on their website that should be able to answer any questions you may have. In summary it is a capable theatre venue that is suited for larger plays and musicals. If you have any questions for us feel free to email [techsoc@yusu.org](mailto:techsoc@yusu.org)
