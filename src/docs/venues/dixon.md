title: Dixon Drama Studio
---

TechSoc has been based in the Dixon since 2020. It's where we store all our equipment, predominantly offer our training, and where we often tech shows for other societies. It's part of the main Wentworth building on Campus West next to Biology and Environment as well as a stones throw away from other venues we work in such as Central Hall and the Rodger Kirk Centre.

## Booking the Venue
Room bookings for the main space are handled by the University Room Bookings team - for bigger productions it's normally advisable to try to plan a year in advance. Smaller bookings (such as for a one night charity fashion show) can be made [online](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/departments/support-and-admin/estates-and-campus-services/space-services/studentroombooking/). Once you've secured a room booking please get in touch with us to start to make plans for your event!

## Venue Capacity
For dance floor, venue for music and similar events (and bar areas without fixed seating) the **maximum occupancy is 220**. The capacity of the space is governed by the number of exits and the floor area.

For seated events (such as conferences/theatre shows/meetings) the **maximum occupancy is 174** including cast and crew.

For use as an exhibition hall or Film, Radio, Television recording - or use as an Exam Hall the **maximum occupancy is 100.**

All of the dressing room spaces have their own fire escapes, such that each of them have a total theoretical fire capacity of 60 people, but we'd consider them each to have a more practical maximum of 10-20 people.
