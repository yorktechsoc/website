TechSoc has worked with Theatre@41 for a number of years now to mainly to support CHMS productions, it is a venue that we enjoy working in and gives the performing company lots of flexibility in how they choose to use the space, perfect for most medium audience events from Comedy Nights to Musicals.

## Booking the Venue

Bookings for the main John Cooper Studio performance space are handled by Theatre@41 so you should get in contact with them [here](https://www.41monkgate.co.uk/johncooperstudio) to book the space. For bigger productions it's normally advisable to try to plan a year in advance as the space is very popular. Once you have a booking get in touch with us to start to make plans for your event!

## Venue Capacity

The maximum capacity of the Studio Theatre is 130 (including performers, backstage crew and technical operators, etc). There is a balcony area which may be used during performances, however lighting this are a requires extra planning so please inform us early if you ar planning to use this aspect. On the balcony level is also where the band "pit" resides which can fit a decent size musical band if allowed to spill onto the upstage balcony area.
Finally the space has 2 small dressing rooms at stage level, they are not the most spacious so consider this when planning to use the venue.

## The Space

This is a unique theatre space for all types of performance and larger rehearsals. The standard seating configuration is end-on. However, the staging blocks which create the raised seating area are not fixed, and the theatre is ideal for use in a variety of configurations. The space measures 10.51m x 15.72m
The Theatre@41 team have a fantastic technical [wiki](https://sites.google.com/41monkgate.co.uk/technicalwiki/) detailing the technical specification of the space, but in summary it is a fun flexible venue that can take all types of shows and TechSoc always enjoys working in the space, if you have any questions for us feel free to email [techsoc@yusu.org](mailto:techsoc@yusu.org)
