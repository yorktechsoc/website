TechSoc has a large stock of sound equipment that is available for hire. We have a range of microphones, speakers, amplifiers, and mixing desks. We also have a range of audio cables and stands available for hire. For a fully up to date list, including prices and availability, please don't hesitate to get in touch with [techsoc@yorksu.org](mailto:techsoc@yorksu.org).

## Mixing Desks

We have two Allen and Heath mixing desks, the [SQ5](https://www.allen-heath.com/sq-series/sq-5/) and [Qu-16](https://www.allen-heath.com/qu-series/qu-16). In addition to the two mixing desks, we have a pair of [AR2412](https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/io-ar2412) digital stage boxes. The SQ5 can be connected to both stage boxes; due to the additional SQ SLink port, the Qu-16 can only be connected to one stage box.

The SQ5 is our primary mixer, with the ability to mix 48 channels, with 16 onboard preamps, 12 stereo mixes + LR, and a 32x32 USB Audio Interface. The Qu-16 is a smaller mixer, which is normally installed in the Dixon Drama Studio.

Thirdly, we have an [X Air XR18](https://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_x_air_xr18.htm); we'd highly recommend the use of this with an external Access Point. This is a portable mixer, with 18 channels, 6 auxes, and a multichannel USB audio interface. This is a great mixer for small events; you would mix it using an iPad or laptop.
