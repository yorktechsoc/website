## Welcome to TechSoc!

### What We Do

As a member of TechSoc you will be involved in the production and operation of all the technical elements of shows, from lighting to sound to video. We provide technical services for all types of events including plays, musicals, concerts, sports competitions and much more.
We have a large stock of industry standard equipment meaning our members get to use and train on the same kit you will find on events all round the country. Many of our members have taken skills learnt in TechSoc into jobs in the industry.

If you want to get involved sign up to our slack channel using the link below or give us a message on Instagram, or by email, and we will tell you about the best way to get you involved. No prior knowledge is required, and we make sure you can get involved in real events no matter your past experience.

### Slack

Our primary communication method in the society is Slack. You can use our [signup link (here)](https://join.slack.com/t/yorktechsoc/shared_invite/zt-1df8p8flv-fqj2an8oJEx0n50Bjz~g~Q) to join, or create an account with your Uni of York email, and add us by [joining other workspaces here](https://slack.com/get-started#/).

We have a number of general channels, (including #general, #questions and #random) and each project has its own channel. You're more than welcome to join any channel that looks interesting and ask there how you get involved with that project!

### AdamRMS

AdamRMS is our resource and project management system. It's where we assign assets and organise crew for our events.

To sign up, head to https://dash.adam-rms.com/, log in with your University email and then click "Join" on the Technical Theatre Society entry.
