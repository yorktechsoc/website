# York TechSoc Website

A [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) website for the University of York's Technical Theatre Society. It is automatically built using GitHub actions and deployed GitHub pages. The site is available at [yorktechsoc.org](https://yorktechsoc.org).

## Hosting

The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/); on the YorkTechSoc CloudFlare account, this brings it in line with the Wiki.

## Setup

To run the site locally, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then, in the root directory of the project, run:

```console
npm install
```

This will install the required dependencies, including a spellchecker and prettier. To run the site locally, run:

```console
npm run start
```

You can also check out the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for more information on how to use Docusaurus. In future we'd like to add some documentation on our equipment and how to use it, so if you have any experience with our equipment, please do add some pages!
